#Autonomous Vehicles – Lori Dunford#

##Introduction##

My name is Lori Dunford. I am a 33 year old woman, web development student at St Clair College, who has actually never had a driver's license. Asked even 5 years ago if I thought self driving vehicles would be a part of our future, my answer would have been that while, yes, it was likely, it would likely not be a for a very long time ahead. 

Then again, I imagine when Karl Benz created the first car in the late 1800's, he didn't imagine the standards we have now such as anti-lock brakes and power steering, let alone GPS navigation and satellite radio. 

Admittedly, I knew next to nothing about most vehicles in general, let alone the technologies being worked towards. The idea of self driving cars was something of science fiction movies to me. Mind you, this was before I had a cell phone that knew where I was and could tell me about traffic conditions, weather and what restaurants had vegan options, everywhere I went. 

Sure, we had the Roomba vacuume. It could make it's way around your house without killing your sleeping cat. Facinating. However, avoiding things at least twice its size within your living room seems a heck of a lot easier, not to mention safer, than 3500+lbs chunks of metal going 50km/h avoiding each other and your sleeping cat.  

I guess it just goes to show: time changes everything.

##The Beginning##

It's not by chance that the first semi-driverless vehicles were not cars. Planes, boats, submarines did this first and for good reason; there is a lot less traffic and no pedestrians in the air and ocean. Another plane or boat were pretty hard to miss and certainly weren't suddenly turning in front of you out of nowhere. If a bird or fish became a casualty of technology, there was little risk of lawsuits and/or major loss.

Combine this with our technologies towards space exploration and, a less noble science: missles. We could shoot a probe all the way up into space without a driver. We could shoot a missle to the other side of the world to do our dirty work. All from our far away comfort, letting our little explorer/death machine guide itself with the technology we gave it.

This was the beginning. We just needed to fine tune to the distractions and unpredictable nature of the road.

While experiments on the idea of automous cars have been happening since the 1920's and 1930's, the first true autonomous cars came about in the 1980's. The Robotics Institute at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University had the Navlab project in 1984 with their first vehicle, Navlab 1, beginning production in 1986. While Nav 1 could only reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h), Nav 2 when driven on road could reach a top speed of 70 mph (110 km/h). Most of their vehicles were semi-autonomous, some were fully automous, needing no human input. 


Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University had the EUREKA Prometheus Project from 1987 to 1995, the largest research and development project ever in the field of driverless cars. Their first major accomplishment was when they had their twin robot vehicles, VaMP and VITA-2, drive more than 1000km on a Paris multi-lane highway. They showed examples of convoy driving, automatic tracking f other vehicles, left and right lane changing and autonomous passing of other cars.

Their next big accomplishment was having their re-engineered S-Class Mercedes-Benz drive a 1000 mile trip from Munich, Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark. They managed to achieve speeds exceeding 175km/h on the German Autobahn. 158Km of the trip was done without any human intervention.

##Today##

Many major companies and research organizations have created working prototype autonomous cars. Some being: Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Oxford University and, probably best known, Tesla Motors and Google.

Currently, self-driving cars are legally allowed on roads for testing purposes in Nevada, Florida, California, Michigan and Washington, DC. Texas, New Hampshire, Arizona and Wisconsin have rejected these laws and many other states are still in consideration.
